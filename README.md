ncurses-rs
==========

There is not yet any test suite, so, rest assured, there
will be bugs. If you find one, please make a ticket and/or
submit a pull request!

## Building
The compiled library will go to the `lib` directory.
```
make
```

## Examples
Examples are built automagically. To run them, check the `bin`
directory. Example numbers increase along with the complexity
of the example.

## Thanks
Thanks for pnkfelix for his initial version of this
library, [rust-curses](https://github.com/pnkfelix/rust-curses),
from which ncurses-rs was able to blossom.
